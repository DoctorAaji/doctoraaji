                <h2>Why DoctorAaji's?</h2>
                <p>
                    The first 1000 days, from conception to two years of age, are referred to as the <em>"Window of Opportunity"</em> by UNICEF. During this time, a child’s nutrition and care build the foundation for lifelong growth, learning, and thriving. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The first 1000 days are critical for building the foundation of a healthy and fulfilling life."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In today’s nuclear families, young parents often need extra guidance and support. DoctorAaji and DoctorAajoba bridge this gap, offering a blend of traditional wisdom and modern science to empower families for this life-changing journey.
